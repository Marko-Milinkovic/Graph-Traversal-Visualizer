A sophisticated algorithm visualization platform that demonstrates fundamental graph traversal and pathfinding techniques through interactive visual simulations. 
This C++ implementation provides precise, step-by-step visualization of 7 core graph traversal algorithms with customizable execution parameters. 
Designed for computer science education and algorithmic analysis, the tool highlights each algorithm's unique node exploration patterns, frontier behavior, and path derivation logic. 
The visualization contrasts algorithmic approaches to reveal their relative efficiencies in solving identical graph problems. 
Professional-grade features include weighted edge support, heuristic customization for informed searches, and comprehensive performance metrics.
